Kernel:
Containers use the hosts kernel to operate.

Hardware/computing resources:
Obviously since containers run on the same system as the host OS, they have to share physical resources.

Network:
Containers can be configured to share the hosts network connection. By default, they are isolated.

Files:
Files can be shared between the host and containers through a mechanism called volumes. This exposes a portion of the hosts file system to the containers.
